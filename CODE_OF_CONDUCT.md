# Code of Conduct

Rules and consequences for behavior within the project community.

## Goals

There is simple rule of thumb for interactions within this community: be respectful.

We all have different opinions and beliefs. We all disagree with others sometimes. But that does not mean that we have to be impolite towards each other.

Fundamental rules for interactions:

- Be respectful
- Do not insult
- Do not get personal
- Do not spread false information
- Do not endorse violence

You also have to behave legally, according to the law of your country and the law in Germany.

## Enforcement

Breaking the Code of Conduct will result in an exclusion from the project.

## Reporting

Please report violations to the project's maintainer[^1].
